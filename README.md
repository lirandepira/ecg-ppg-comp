Aware of the easiness of photoplethysmography (PPG) measurement,
this research is a tentative to prove that PPG results are as accurate as
Those of electrocardiogram (ECG) (at rest). The two employed ways to measure PPG and ECG,
are the Smartphone camera - the signal is then filtered in MATLAB - and the Bitalino board kit, respectively.
The obtained results are highly accurate, thus the two employed ways of measuring the Heart Rate are reliable.
